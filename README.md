# mekanical

The mekanical is a 13.5u 40% pcb with full basekit support. It takes its design cues from the [oxymoron](https://imgur.com/a/UKyKxDe), [bully](https://www.cbkbd.com/product/bully) and [ttocyobitna](https://trashman.wiki/keyboards/ttocyobitna) amongst others. It's a stm32 based pcb for low cost, good performance. Case and mounting has not been finalised yet.
